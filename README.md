- 👋 Hi, I’m @KachaJugaad!
- 👀 I’m passionate about product management, operation management, ideation, and programming.
- 🌱 Currently, I’m diving into Python, React.js, and collaborating with some tech geniuses to build a product.
- 💞️ I’m eager to collaborate on tech ideas that solve everyday problems, especially if we can tackle them as a team.
- 🍞 On a serious note, I’m on the lookout for new job opportunities to support my education. Plus, I love building things from the ground up or scaling and personalizing existing products (I’ve been doing this for 12+ years!).
- 📫 Want to chat? Great! You can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashutoshukla) or drop me a message at [jugaadvaale.com](https://jugaadvaale.com/)
